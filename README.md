### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Florian!
I'm an open source software developer from Munich, Germany! <br>
I currently actively develop open source software mainly in R and Python.
Here you can find my current projects and research interests!

#### Current Projects

**R**

I am a member of the [mlr-org]() core-team, we develop the [mlr3]() ecosystem.<br>
I personally have authored / contributed to the following packages:
- [mlr3book](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3book)
- [mlr3pipelines](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines)
- [mlr3temporal](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3temporal)
- [mlr3fairness](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3fairness)
- [mlr3keras](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3keras)

I furthermore worked on several other software packages:
- [mcboost]()
- [classiFunc](https://github.com/maierhofert/classiFunc) (defunct)


**Python**

-  [YAHPO GYM:](https://github.com/slds-lmu/yahpo-gym) <br>
  I am currently working on improving [yahpo-gym](https://github.com/slds-lmu/yahpo-gym), a toolbox for researchers in hyperparameter optimization.<br>
  It is built using `Pytorch` and `ONNX` and allows lightweight and lightining fast access to neural network based surrogates.

#### Interests

I am interested in developing software that brings a tangible benefit to users and society.<br>
I'd like to work in and learn more about the following areas:
- Deep Learning on tabular data
- Algorithmic fairness
- MLOps
- Hyperparameter Optimization
- Everything AutoML

#### Freelancing

If you are interested in working together, either on open source projects or on other projects, contact me!
I have worked in a freelance capacity in several different projects before and I am always interested in getting to know new people and tackling interesting problems!
