### Hi there 👋 I am Florian!
I'm an OSS from Munich, Germany! <br>
I am an active open source software developer, developing open source software mainly in R and Python.
Here you can find my current projects and research interests!

#### Current Projects

**R**

I am a member of the [mlr-org]() core-team, we develop the [mlr3]() ecosystem.<br>
I personally have authored / contributed to the following packages:
- [mlr3book](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3book)
- [mlr3pipelines](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines)
- [mlr3fda](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3fda)
- [mlr3fairness](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3fairness)

I furthermore worked on several other software packages:
- [mcboost]()
- [classiFunc](https://github.com/maierhofert/classiFunc) (defunct)


**Python**

-  [YAHPO GYM:](https://github.com/slds-lmu/yahpo-gym) <br>
  I am currently working on improving [yahpo-gym](https://github.com/slds-lmu/yahpo-gym), a toolbox for researchers in hyperparameter optimization.<br>
  It is built using `Pytorch` and `ONNX` and allows lightweight and lightining fast access to neural network based surrogates.

#### Interests

I am interested in developing software that brings a tangible benefit to users and society.<br>
I'd like to work in and learn more about the following areas:
- Deep Learning on tabular data
- Algorithmic fairness
- MLOps
- Hyperparameter Optimization
- Everything AutoML

#### Other Info

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about MLOps concepts and using Kubernetes
- 💬 Ask me about R, ML, HPO, One-shot Optimization and Algorithmic Fairness
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
